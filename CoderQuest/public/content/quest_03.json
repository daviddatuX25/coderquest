If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this: <code>let car1 = 'Saab'; let car2 = 'Volvo';</code></p><p>However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 2, but 200 cars? The solution is an array!</p><h2>Example:</h2><p><code>let cars = ['Saab', 'Volvo', 'BMW'];</code></p><p>You can access an element by referring to its index number: <code>let firstCar = cars[0];</code></p>"
